### BIM | Data Science | Construction Tech

Specialized in bridging the gap between construction data and 3D computational performance. I build tools to optimize 3D assets for the web and analyze building information using data science pipelines.

## Technical Stack

| Domain | Technologies & Standards |
| :--- | :--- |
| **BIM (Building Information Modelling)** | IFC (Industry Foundation Classes), Blender, Revit |
| **3D Web Graphics** | Three.js, WebGL, glTF/GLB Optimization |
| **Data Science** | Python (Pandas, NumPy), Scikit-learn, Computer Vision |
| **Performance** | Asset Compression, LOD (Level of Detail) Automation |

## Research I am currently working on:

### 3d_modelling: 

A repository where I try to understand the nuances of 3D modelling from wireframe compression, to web hosting.
