### Data Science | Construction

My goal is to enhance the use of current construction data science techniques with lightweight 3D graphics.

## Technical Stack

| Domain | Technologies & Standards |
| :--- | :--- |
| **BIM (Building Information Modelling)** | IFC (Industry Foundation Classes), Blender, Revit |
| **3D Web Graphics** | Three.js, WebGL, glTF/GLB Optimization |
| **Data Science** | Python (Pandas, NumPy), Scikit-learn, Computer Vision |
| **Performance** | Asset Compression, LOD (Level of Detail) Automation |

## Research I am currently working on:

### [3d_modelling:](https://github.com/suryashch/3d_modelling) 

A repository where I try to understand the nuances of 3D modelling from wireframe compression, to web hosting.
